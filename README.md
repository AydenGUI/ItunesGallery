# ItunesGallery
 The iTunes Gallery is a JavaFX application that allows users to search and view images from the iTunes Store. It uses the iTunes 
Search API to fetch images and displays them in a grid view. Users are able to play and pause the image slideshow which replaces 
a random displayed result with an undisplayed every second. Users are also able to search for more media and change the category 
type that they are searching for. The program is run using the command ./run.sh.
